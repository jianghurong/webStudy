This guide is primarily for users with prior Vue 2 experience who want to learn about the new features and changes in Vue 3. This is not something you have to read from top to bottom before trying out Vue 3. While it looks like a lot has changed, a lot of what you know and love about Vue is still the same; but we wanted to be as thorough as possible and provide detailed explanations and examples for every documented change.

Some of the new features to keep an eye on in Vue 3 include:

Composition API

Creating Vue components allows us to extract repeatable parts of the interface coupled with its functionality into reusable pieces of code. This alone can get our application pretty far in terms of maintainability and flexibility. However, our collective experience has proved that this alone might not be enough, especially when your application is getting really big â€“ think several hundred components. When dealing with such large applications, sharing and reusing code becomes especially important.
